    <p>This is my mother's and grandmother's recipe from Western Tennessee. I have never found anything that comes close to the flavor of these pancakes. Add small berries for a different flavor boost. Serve with butter and maple syrup.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <Ul>
        <li>2 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </Ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle to medium heat, according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add buttermilk, eggs, and butter; stir together until well blended but do not stir out all of the small lumps. Overmixing the batter will make the pancakes tough and rubbery.</li>
        <li>Pour oil on a paper towel and spread over the griddle to grease lightly. Test the griddle with a few drops of water; water should dance across the surface and not instantly steam and evaporate.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, drop 1/4 to 1/3 cupfuls batter for each pancake onto the hot griddle. Cook until the sides start to shine and look stiff, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, about 2 more minutes. Repeat to make remaining pancakes.</li>
    </ol>
